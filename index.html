                      <p>
                        An Emerson College grad, I like work that tickles my curiosity, and I'm curious about everything. For me, it's all about trying to understand this place we all live in. I've worked on projects ranging from critical analysis of television shows to online courses on big data to video recipes of new and different styles of food. If you can learn something new from it, I want to help make it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Check out my portfolio or my web series Ideas At Play to see what I'm talking about, and reach out to tell me what you think about my work or if you'd like to work together.

                          The Leftovers 101–210: HBO 
                        </h3>
                      </a>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        It might not surprise you to learn that I’m a huge fan of Lost. It’s a series that I’ve watched from start to finish a number of times, taken a class on in college, and written a 17-page paper about concerning its use of time travel (side note: avoid writing in-depth analyses on circular time travel unless you have some decent migraine medication). But despite my love of Damon Lindelof’s masterpiece, I had been hesitant to get into The Leftovers. Part of me felt that nothing he could ever do would live up to Lost, which has to be one of the 10 most important shows in the history of peak TV. I mean, just look at Prometheus and Tomorrowland. But I digress. This isn’t about Lost, it’s about The Leftovers.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        The other part of me was scared of the emotional weight of The Leftovers’ subject matter. I wasn’t super excited to spend 10-20 hours dealing with the tremendous existential weight of seeing 2% of the world’s population disappear before my eyes, knowing that there are no answers. I didn’t need that in my life. But I was wrong. I was so wrong (is this the real theme of this newsletter?).
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        It’s hard not to watch this show and think of it as the spiritual sequel to Lost. Where the critics of Lost clamored about its lack of satisfying answers, The Leftovers tells us up front that some of these questions simply don’t have answers. We’ll never know, and that’s the point. If you can never know, what do you do next? But, honestly, that angle sells the show incredibly short.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        Lindelof’s greatest strength as a writer is his ability to make you feel that there is some greater power at work. More than just hint at those unseen forces which move our story along, he gives them a profound  presence that feels almost physical. You start to feel as though you’re just a stick in a river, trying to make sense of where you are, while never being able to fully comprehend the vastness of the powers that guide you. It’s the central conflict in a lot of Lindelof’s work, but in The Leftovers, there isn’t much to distract from that idea. The show is a meditation on coming to terms with the unknowable forces that dictate all of our lives. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        When I finished the second season, I didn’t talk to anyone for a solid 24 hours because I needed time to process the vast emotional depths the show had introduced me to. The Leftovers walks the divide between abstraction, surrealism, and reality in a way that almost begs to be left unanalysed. I could fawn over every decision the creators made: the interlocking networks of characters’ stories, the depth of each character’s emotional journey and how each actor communicates the complexities of them, the symbolism, the MUSIC. But what I find the most powerful is how the show resonates on a level beneath the surface in a way I have yet to fully understand. If the show is a concert, this is the vibration of the bass—far from the spotlight, yet still coloring your experience completely.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        There are truly too many aspects of this show that I love to fit into 500 words, so I might revisit this in a future newsletter or make a video on it. But there’s also the distinct possibility that I’ll never be able to fully wrap my head around it. And that’s okay too.

                        </h3>
                      </a>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        I’ve mentioned before that The Americans is my favorite show on TV right now so I watched this season in a bit of a rose-colored haze for a while. And then at some point I looked in the mirror and asked myself, “Did you really like that 15 minutes hole digging scene from the premiere or are you just blinded by your own fandom?” It was a tough call. Ultimately, I decided that I like dirt, shovels, and Stanley Yelnats, but my faith was shaken.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        Every slow scene after that had me questioning if the show had lost its way and was coasting on its reputation and secure future. Philip, Elizabeth, and the gang spent a larger swath of their time combing through rooms looking for the slightest clues to tie their operations up, and I found myself grasping for the threads that must be holding the story together. Even the truly heartwarming moments left me thinking, after I wiped away my teary eyes, “Wait, why did that happen?”
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        And then towards the end of the season it clicked into place. I realized that the narrative force the show had been meandering around, which it had spent so much time developing, all came back to the central thesis of the show: identity. Throughout the series we've heard Philip, Elizabeth, and other Directorate S agents concede that the Soviet Union has its problems, but that was as far as those conversations got. This was the first time that The Americans has shifted its attention toward defining what it means to be Russian.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        Even as the show has offered an alternative to the American perspective on the Cold War, this season it truly humanized the Soviets instead of just humanizing those Soviets who are pretending to be Americans. Oleg reintroduced himself to his homeland and his family’s history. Philip and Elizabeth were faced with a decision that pitted their dual identities against each other in ways that they’ve never had before, while Paige and Henry symbolized the two sides of this same coin. It wasn’t my favorite season of The Americans, but it was undoubtedly great and I apologize to the Jennings family for my wavering faith. It will never happen again.

                          Dunkirk/Baby Driver
                        </h3>
                      </a>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                       What? Movies? Oh yeah. I saw two movies in theaters recently, doubling my yearly total. And they were great. I know I’m late to the party on both of these films, but I do think they’re worth talking about as opposite ends of the same spectrum.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        At first glance, Dunkirk and Baby Driver seem like totally different movies. And they are. They’re distinct films that embody their creators. In film, there’s an idea known as auteur theory, where a director controls a work to such great extent that they're said to be its author, and the work their singular vision. And with Baby Driver and Dunkirk, it feels as though Edgar Wright and Christopher Nolan were born to make these movies.
                      </p> 
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        If you’ve seen any of Edgar Wright’s previous work, you know that his style is fast-paced fun. He makes dynamic scenes, using every visual and audio trick he can think of. His films move. So it only makes sense that he’d make the best music video of a getaway driver ever made. Baby Driver is fast, bright, and fun, a showcase of every audiovisual technique Wright’s ever used to tell a story since he first started filmmaking.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        On the other end, Dunkirk is tense, muted, and serious. It contains nearly no dialogue, features a soundtrack heavy on ticking clocks, and takes place across three overlapping timelines of varying lengths. These innovative concepts build tension in ways I’ve never seen in a mainstream film, and certainly not together. Christopher Nolan is known for his filmic puzzles, his sometimes overly-layered plots, and his unique manipulation of time.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        These films are showcases, portfolios of each director’s greatest hits, given free reign to be fully realized. But what I find most interesting about these films is not that they’re created by auteurs. Many films have their director’s fingerprints all over them. The reason I find these two to be on the same spectrum is because they are two drastically different takes on what kind of spectacle a movie should be.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        With the prestige television industry exploding—and because we live in a culture of instant gratification—filmmakers are struggling to find a way to get audiences to come to the theaters. Why should you go spend $15 to see “Enter Latest Oscar Nominated Film Here” when you can binge Breaking Bad and then catch that film on demand in five months? The answer seems unanimously to be spectacle. No matter how good television sets or surround sound systems get, they can’t quite rival the awe a movie theater can induce.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        And in Baby Driver and Dunkirk, Wright and Nolan offer their opposing approaches to that answer. Neither is particularly interested in plot or story here, but instead in telling those stories in the most interesting and striking ways. Dunkirk is an art-house war movie designed to build tension that feels (and looks) like drowning, all carried by the drama and visual gravitas of World War II. Baby Driver’s plot is a vehicle—ha!—for set piece after set piece of quick cutting, highly choreographed action.
                      </p>
                      <p class="content-blog">
                        Watching the trailers for Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther, I can already feel this idea of auteur spectacle creeping into the realm of franchises. They’re both highly stylized, light on the details, and serve as showcases for their unique aesthetics. I’m not sure if this is going to be the new normal for film: story and character taking a backseat with the aesthetic being the main draw and work on display. That kind of world makes me hesitant, as it’s just a stone’s throw from all-flash-no-substance, but for now, it sure does make for a good movie-going experience.
